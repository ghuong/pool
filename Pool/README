Compilation:
In the cs488 folder, run `premake4 gmake`, then `make`.
Then cd into cs488/Pool, and run `premake4 gmake`, then `make`.
To start the application, run `./Pool`.

Manual:

I edited MeshConsolidator and ObjFileDecoder in the shared/cs488-framework,
which is why I am including the top-level cs488 directory as well.

Controls:
Arrow keys to fly around.
Hold right-mouse button and drag mouse to look around.
Left-click while crosshair is over a ball to shoot it forward.
Adjust power of shot in ImGui.

Objectives Completed:
1: The UI consists of camera movement and striking at balls.
2: A scene depicting a Billiards Game will be modelled.
3: Static collision detection is used for collisions between balls and the walls
of the table.
4: Dynamic collision detection is used for collisions between balls.
7: Animation will be applied on the balls as they move on the table.
9: A simple physics engine with operations for:
   (a) impulse
   (b) friction
   (c) gravity
10: The balls and felt surface will be texture mapped.

Objectives Not Completed:
5: Sounds will play when striking a ball and during collisions.
6: Motion blur will emphasize fast movement.
8: Shadows will be done using Shadow Mapping.

Objectives Partially Completed (please have mercy):
9: Did not implement gravity
10: The room, table wood and felt are texture mapped, but not the balls

Borrowed code:
- function to load bitmap images from http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-5-a-textured-cube/
- polyroots.{hpp,cpp} from A4
- lua glue code from A3
